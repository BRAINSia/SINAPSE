# WriteSegmentationFiles

this repository currently includes the script for writing segmentation files, as well as the files needed for the html sphinx documentation. When i generated the sphinx files for the .py module, It placed everything in the same directory as the .py script. I am sure there is a way to make this more organized, but I need to look into that more.

the link to the sphinx documentation html file is located in _build/html/index.html  

you can open this file by right clicking and opening with a web browser (file needs to be donwloaded first).

I am still figuring out sphinx documentation, and will keep on improving the organization of that html file, and the comments within the function

Github has a HTML viewer but I havent been able to get the index.html file to work yet
